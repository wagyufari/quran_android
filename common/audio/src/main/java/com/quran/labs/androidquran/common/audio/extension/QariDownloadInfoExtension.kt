/**
 * Determine whether the range of verses is downloaded
 * This will check, for gapless files, if every sura is fully downloaded or not.
 * For gapped files, it will do the aforementioned check, and will alternatively
 * check that all ayat in the range are downloaded.
 *
 * Note that "partially downloaded gapless files" are not really a portion today.
 * Those are simply determined by a .part file existing, and we don't try to figure
 * out which portion of the file is there and which isn't since playback of downloaded
 * gapless files is all or none.
